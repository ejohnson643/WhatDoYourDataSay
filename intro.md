# What Do Your Data Say?

A course to better help you understand your experimental data.

## Course Description

Modern data streams, whether from biomedical research labs, environmental research teams, or social-media survey projects, are increasingly quantitative and noisy.  In this class, we will teach you to think quantitatively and statistically about your data, so that you can confidently answer the question "*What do my data (actually) say?*"

To help you answer this question, we present an approach centered on applying mathematical and statistical techniques the modern way: with a computer.  This course is not a substitute for a machine learning or statistics class, instead we will give you a framework for performing parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and dimensionality reduction in a practical, computational, and data-justified way.  At the end of the course, students will possess a set of tools that will allow them to attack any quantitative problem, form a conclusions, and assess their confidence in that conclusion.

## Course Goals

This course is centered on student achievement in four learning goals:

<mark style="background-color: #6b9cee">Data Manipulation and Visualization:</mark> Students will learn to manipulate data into useful formats, construct precise and meaningful figures that clearly demonstrate a data set's quantitative features.

<mark style="background-color: #e26563">Performing Calculations and Simulations:</mark> Students will learn to make calculations of novel quantities and perform in silico experiments while writing easily understandable code.

<mark style="background-color: #ffda5c">Thinking Statistically:</mark> Students will learn to identify quantitative phenomena, generate statistical hypotheses, and pose problems in terms of hypothesis tests, while also being able to identify limitations of their analyses.

<mark style="background-color: #92c57a">Navigating Quantitative Problems:</mark> Students will develop problem-solving strategies for quantitative problems, and will learn to differentiate amongst different strategies in order to choose optimal solutions.

In focusing this course on explicit learning objectives, we hope to make the intent of all parts of the curriculum clear to the students.  We will continue to invoke this framework throughout the course, including via [curriculum alignment tables](./CourseFiles/CurriculumAlignmentTables), module rubrics, and student self-assessments to accompany each assignment.  The idea here is that we can communicate the intent of all parts of the curriculum in a variety of ways.  Every worksheet, assignment, and set of notes will also contain specific learning objectives for that piece of content.  Examples of such learning objectives are:

 - Students will learn to use random numbers in Python to simulate the diffusion of molecules.
 - Students will learn to use vertical and horizontal lines on figures to make meaningful annotations.
 - Students will learn to construct and visualize theoretical and empirical probability distributions.
 - Students will learn to use Bayes theorem to generate parameter estimates.
 - Students will learn to use bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals for arbitrary quantities.
 - Students will learn to assess the likelihood that two sets of data have the same parent distribution in a variety of ways.

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites for this course, but prior experience in coding, probability, and linear algebra will be useful.  There is an informal prerequisite that you are interested in rigorously performing data analysis.

## Content and Instruction

Course content is divided into four modules and will be distributed in the form of course notes and lecture videos that are available on Panopto to enrolled students. The following link should give access to anyone logged into Panopto with a Northwestern email address.  These notes and videos are complementary, not redundant.  Coding practice via worksheets will accompany each content module.  All course content may be updated or altered at any point, so please make sure to check that you are working with the most recent versions.

We strongly encourage you to make use of Canvas' discussion board for help with material and coding.  We will create themed discussions for each module, but you should feel free to start a discussion on any course related (or unrelated) topic!

## Assessments

Similar to an experimental lab course, we hope that the majority of your time in this course will be spent problem solving: writing code to analyze data.  We will assess, or facilitate your self-assessment of, your performance via several methods:

1. **Worksheets**: Each module will have several accompanying worksheets, which are self-contained guided adventures for practicing different concepts and techniques.  This is the primary way in which you will practice the skills in this course before you attempt the assignments.  As such, they are **strongly encouraged!**  If needed, we will dedicate time during office hours to working on the worksheets, and the code you write for the worksheets will generally be *directly applicable* to solving the assignments, so you should always make sure to look them over.  However, these worksheets will not be graded.  We will do our best to provide solutions, but this may not be possible at this point - it will be better to start a discussion or bring it up during office hours. 

2. **Assignments**: Each module will have an assignment that will typically be a longer and more difficult version of the worksheets.  Assignments will consist of two phases: an **attempt** at the the assignment and then completion of the assignment.  Assignments will comprise 70% of the final grade, with attempt and completion phases equally weighted.  Earlier assignments will count less towards your grade than those for the later modules.

	1. The **assignment attempt** will be due at the end of the first week of each module.  The attempt should consist of either a Jupyter notebook or a PDF documenting either how you have solved a specific assignment problem **or thoughts** on how you plan to solve it.   The central idea behind these two phases is that you are incentivized to plan your time so that you don't find that you have no idea what's going on the night before the assignment is due.  Some examples of what constitutes an attempt can be found [here](https://github.com/ejohnson643/WhatDoYourDataSay/blob/main/CourseFiles/WhatDoYourDataSay_SampleAssignmentAttempt.pdf).

	2. After the attempts have been submitted, we will provide guided hints and useful code for most of the assignment, which are called the "non-bonus" problems.  These will not generally be outright solutions, and in such cases, you can use this resource to complete your assignment, referencing whenever you directly use provided code.

	3. The **completed assignment** will then be due a week after the attempt has been submitted.  This completed assignment must be submitted as code and a **PDF overview** of your solutions.  For more details on how solutions should be structured and submitted, look here.  Assignments will be graded according to a [standards-based grading scheme](https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/seven-reasons-for-standards-based-grading) using our overarching [course rubric](./CourseFiles/Rubric).

3. **Self-Assessments**: Once completed assignments have been submitted, we will distribute a complete solution set and will ask you to make a self-assessment of your performance on the assignment in the form of a Canvas quiz.  These will only be graded for completion, and are provided as a tool for you to develop self-evaluative skills.  As you go forward in life you will rarely have regular formal assessments, and instead you must learn to evaluate your own work. These guides are our attempt to help you reflect on the levels of proficiency you have achieved.  Completion of these assessments will comprise 10% of your final grade.  For more info on self-assessments, look here.

4. Midterm: In the middle of the quarter we will have an online midterm examination.  The midterm will focus on conceptual aspects of the course (rather than memorized facts), as well as some practical skills, such as analyzing figures, debugging code, and making calculations by hand.   The midterm will comprise 20% of your final grade.
