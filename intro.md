# What Do Your Data Say?

A course to better help you understand your experimental data.

## Course Description

Modern data streams, whether from biomedical research labs, environmental research teams, or social-media survey projects, are increasingly quantitative and noisy.  In this class, we will teach you to think quantitatively and statistically about your data, so that you can confidently answer the question "*What do my data (actually) say?*"

To help you answer this question, we present an approach centered on applying mathematical and statistical techniques the modern way: with a computer.  This course is not a substitute for a machine learning or statistics class, instead we will give you a framework for performing parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and dimensionality reduction in a practical, computational, and data-justified way.  At the end of the course, students will possess a set of tools that will allow them to attack any quantitative problem, form a conclusions, and assess their confidence in that conclusion.

## Course Goals

This course is centered on student achievement in four learning goals:

<mark style="background-color: #6b9cee">Data Manipulation and Visualization:</mark> Students will learn to manipulate data into useful formats, construct precise and meaningful figures that clearly demonstrate a data set's quantitative features.

<mark style="background-color: #e26563">Performing Calculations and Simulations:</mark> Students will learn to make calculations of novel quantities and perform in silico experiments while writing easily understandable code.

<mark style="background-color: #ffda5c">Thinking Statistically:</mark> Students will learn to identify quantitative phenomena, generate statistical hypotheses, and pose problems in terms of hypothesis tests, while also being able to identify limitations of their analyses.

<mark style="background-color: #92c57a">Navigating Quantitative Problems:</mark> Students will develop problem-solving strategies for quantitative problems, and will learn to differentiate amongst different strategies in order to choose optimal solutions.

In focusing this course on explicit learning objectives, we hope to make the intent of all parts of the curriculum clear to the students.  We will continue to invoke this framework throughout the course, including via [curriculum alignment tables](./CourseFiles/CurriculumAlignmentTables), module rubrics, and student self-assessments to accompany each assignment.  The idea here is that we can communicate the intent of all parts of the curriculum in a variety of ways.  Every worksheet, assignment, and set of notes will also contain specific learning objectives for that piece of content.  Examples of such learning objectives are:

 - Students will learn to use random numbers in Python to simulate the diffusion of molecules.
 - Students will learn to use vertical and horizontal lines on figures to make meaningful annotations.
 - Students will learn to construct and visualize theoretical and empirical probability distributions.
 - Students will learn to use Bayes theorem to generate parameter estimates.
 - Students will learn to use bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals for arbitrary quantities.
 - Students will learn to assess the likelihood that two sets of data have the same parent distribution in a variety of ways.
