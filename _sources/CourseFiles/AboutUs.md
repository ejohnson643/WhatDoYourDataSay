[Dr. Eric Johnson](https://ejohnson643.github.io/AboutMe/) is a passionate educator and researcher, currently living in Minneapolis, Minnesota with his longtime partner and two cats. He works as a postdoctoral researcher for the [Mani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=81qY5lEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Pincus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Jg6FmzsAAAAJ) groups at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, where he studies the ways in which we analyze high-dimensional data in biology.

[Madhav Mani](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/mani-madhav.html) is an assistant professor of applied mathematics and molecular biosciences. In close collaboration with experimental labs around the world, his group develops quantitative image-analysis tools and mathematical models that guide the construction of inverse modeling schemes to make new and better measurements of live imaging data. When required, forward mathematical models are constructed to make sense of emergent phenomena, and more importantly, to generate predictions and hypotheses that guide future experimentation. He would like to learn how to analyze quantitatively, write precisely, and think clearly.
