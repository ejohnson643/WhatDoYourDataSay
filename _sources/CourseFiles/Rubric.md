As noted in the syllabus, student achievement is assessed using a [standards-based grading scheme](https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/seven-reasons-for-standards-based-grading), which means that students are evaluated based on whether they have demonstrated different levels of proficiency on different skills. What this means is that after each assessment, a student is assigned a level of mastery for each skill, from good to poor, based on their demonstrated performance. In *What Do Your Data Say?* we are not looking for perfection, but simply progress towards competency in data analysis, so our goal is that students achieve "novice" levels of mastery by the end of the term.
